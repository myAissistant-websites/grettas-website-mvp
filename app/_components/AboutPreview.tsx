                                I've lived and worked in this region long enough to know which neighbourhoods are undervalued right now, which schools are the best-kept secrets, and which streets sell before they even hit the market. I know the neighbourhoods, the schools, the market trends, and what makes each area unique.

                                Before real estate, I spent years at Rogers in data analytics and sales management. That background means I come to every transaction with a clear head and real numbers, not hunches. I'll tell you what your home is actually worth, and I'll tell you honestly if I think an offer is too high.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Real estate is more than just a transaction to me. It is about helping people build their lives and put down roots in a place they can truly call home. I also serve the English, Farsi, Dari, Persian, Hindi, and Urdu-speaking communities across Waterloo Region. If you or your family are more comfortable navigating this process in any of these languages, that's exactly how we'll do it.
